Tired of copy-pasting your example configurations and command outputs into your README?

`mdtmpl` is a dead-simple little CLI tool that runs instructions defined in [Markdown comments](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#hiding-content-with-comments), such as `<!--- {{ my markdown comment }} --->`.
